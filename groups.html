        <h2>Groups Affected By Mental Health Issues</h2>
        <h4>Anxiety, depression and suicide can affect any of us at any time. But at different points in our lives we can be at greater risk – when we're going through big changes such as becoming an adult, retiring, starting a family, or losing someone we love, for example.</h4>
        <h4>Experiencing discrimination because of our sexuality, gender identity, ethnicity or religion can also cause psychological distress and make us much more vulnerable to depression and anxiety.</h4>
        <h4>That’s why Beyond Blue provides information and resources to meet your specific needs, based on what you’re experiencing and your circumstances.</h4>

        <p> Mental health and wellbeing is established early in life and provides children with the foundation for all aspects of their development including physical, educational, social, emotional and cognitive development.</p>

        <img alt="Women" src="Images/Women.jpg" width="500" height= "350" >
        <p> Women are known for putting others first. But when it comes to your health it is important to prioritise your own needs and speak up when you need support.</p>

        <img alt="Old People" src="Images/Old People.jpg" width="500" height= "350" >

        <img alt="LGBTI" src="Images/LGBTQ.jpg" width="500" height= "350" >
        <p> Beyond Blue celebrates the strength, resilience and diversity of LGBTI communities. We believe that the recognition that marriage equality is an issue of equity was an important step towards improving the mental health of LGBTI people. Beyond Blue is proud to celebrate diversity and to have stood up for equality in our community.</p>

        <p> Reducing the impact of depression and anxiety among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities is a priority for Beyond Blue. A range of research, information, education and support strategies have been developed and will continue to be developed in consultation with ATSI communities and organisations.</p>

      <h2>Key Statistics Of Different Groups</h2>
      <h4>As different groups of people are affected by mental health issues, hence as each individual have unique circumstances, it creates different degrees of impact on people.

        <h4><li>One in ten young people aged 12-17 years old will self-harm, one in 13 will seriously consider a suicide attempt, and one in 40 will attempt suicide.</li></h4>
        <h4><li> One in seven young people aged 4 to 17 years experience a mental health condition in any given year.</li></h4>
        <h4><li>  More women than men experience high or very high levels of psychological distress.</li></h4>
        <h4><li>  One in six young LGBTI people has attempted suicide and one third have harmed themselves.</li></h4>
