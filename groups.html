        <h2>Groups Affected By Mental Health Issues</h2>
        <h4>Anxiety, depression and suicide can affect any of us at any time. But at different points in our lives we can be at greater risk – when we're going through big changes such as becoming an adult, retiring, starting a family, or losing someone we love, for example.</h4>
        <h4>Experiencing discrimination because of our sexuality, gender identity, ethnicity or religion can also cause psychological distress and make us much more vulnerable to depression and anxiety.</h4>
        <h4>That’s why Beyond Blue provides information and resources to meet your specific needs, based on what you’re experiencing and your circumstances.</h4>

        <img alt="LGBTI" src="Images/LGBTQ.jpg" width="500" height= "350" >
        <p> Beyond Blue celebrates the strength, resilience and diversity of LGBTI communities. We believe that the recognition that marriage equality is an issue of equity was an important step towards improving the mental health of LGBTI people. Beyond Blue is proud to celebrate diversity and to have stood up for equality in our community.</p>

        <p> Reducing the impact of depression and anxiety among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities is a priority for Beyond Blue. A range of research, information, education and support strategies have been developed and will continue to be developed in consultation with ATSI communities and organisations.</p>
