        <h2>Depression</h2>
        <h4>While we all feel sad, moody or low from time to time, some people experience these feelings intensely, for long periods of time (weeks, months or even years) and sometimes without any apparent reason. Depression is more than just a low mood â€“ it's a serious condition that affects your physical and mental health.</h4>
        <h4>In worst case scenarios, it could drive the victim into extreme consequences, such as attempts at suicide that may result in death.</h4>
